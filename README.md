## Overview

**MagicShaders** is a 2-day intensive learning project focused on mastering shader creation in Unity 6. This project explores the fundamentals of visual effects through the creation of a magic-themed shader collection, covering HLSL programming, Shader Graph, and the VFX Graph particle system.

## Learning Objectives

This project was built to understand:
- How shaders work at a fundamental level
- HLSL shader programming
- Unity's Shader Graph visual scripting
- VFX Graph particle system
- Real-time rendering techniques
- Visual effects optimization

## Project Duration

**2 days** of focused learning and experimentation

## Magic Effects Implemented

### Offensive Spells
- **Giant Fireball**: Volumetric fire shader with particle emission
- **Vortex**: Swirling energy effect with distortion
- **Lightning**: Electric arc effects with branching patterns

### Environmental Effects
- **Misty Water**: Fog and water surface interaction
- **Campfire**: Realistic fire simulation with embers
- **Starry Sky**: Procedural night sky with twinkling stars

## Technologies Used

### HLSL (High-Level Shading Language)
Hand-written shader code for maximum control and learning

### Shader Graph
Visual shader creation for rapid prototyping and iteration

### VFX Graph
Particle system for complex visual effects and simulations

### Unity 6
Latest Unity engine features and rendering pipeline

## What I Learned

- **Shader Fundamentals**: Understanding vertex and fragment shaders
- **HLSL Syntax**: Writing custom shader code
- **Shader Graph Workflow**: Node-based shader creation

## Usage

Each effect can be explored individually in the demo scene. Materials and shaders are located in their respective folders and can be applied to any GameObject.

## Learning Resources Used

- Unity Shader Graph Documentation
- HLSL Reference Guide
- VFX Graph Tutorials
- Community shader examples


## Reflection

This 2-day project provided hands-on experience with Unity's shader ecosystem. Starting from zero knowledge of shader programming, I gained practical understanding of:
- The shader rendering pipeline
- Visual effect optimization techniques
- The balance between visual quality and performance
- Rapid iteration using different tools (HLSL vs Shader Graph)
